# Air-Ticket-Reseravtion-System

OVERVIEW:

This software allows two types of users -Admin -Users(Cutomers) with different types of access for both. 

The GUI based “Air Ticket Reservation System” project is an attempt to stimulate the basic concepts of the Air Ticket Reservation System. The system enables the customer
to do the things such as search for airline flights for two travel cities on a specified date, choose a flight based on the details, reservation of flight and cancellation of
reservation. The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city”
for a particular departure and arrival dates.

The admin can add, modify, delete the customer details and flights by adding, updating flight ID, flight route, flight dates, flight rates and flight seats as and when required and
can also view the list of flights on specific dates and routes. They can also read the feedback provided by the customers for the improvement of the system. They can also
book the tickets in the same way as the customers and enjoy additional access for maintenance of the software.
